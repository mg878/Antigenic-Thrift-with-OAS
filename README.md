# Antigenic Thrift dynamics with population-level Original Antigenic Sin effects 
The antigenic thrift is an alternative model to the antigenic evolution of influenza which was first developed by [S. Gupta et al., 1998](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/280/5365/912.long). Here, we consider a three-locus two-allele system which includes the effect of the original antigenic sin on population dynamics.
We use three epidemiological measurements to quantify the dynamics:
##(1) Dominance period
which is defined the time window during which the frequency of the proportion infectious with a strain i is above a certain threshold with respect to the expected proportion infectious at a local peak infectious.
##(2) Period prevalence
which is defined as the total proportion infected by the strain during the dominance period.
##(3) Re-emergence time 
which is defined as the waiting time between two consecutive dominance periods.
